# The Economics of Epidemics

Welcome to the **Economics of Epidemics** project. This site showcases a collection of research, code, and educational materials developed by the Hunter College Economics faculty and students.

These materials were originally developed and presented at the **Roosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter College** during the early days of the COVID-19 epidemic to help model and understand the unfolding crisis.

Our goal is to explore the intersection of epidemiology and economics, using mathematical models to understand disease dynamics and the impact of various policy interventions.

## What's Inside?

This site is organized into several key areas:

### 🧬 Core SIR Models
Explore the fundamental building blocks of epidemic modeling, from basic **SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered)** models to extended versions that incorporate more complex dynamics.

### ⚖️ Policy & Economics
Analyze the critical trade-offs between public health outcomes and economic activity. These notebooks examine how different policies can flatten the curve while considering their economic costs.

### 🌐 Network Models
Investigate how the structure of social and geographic networks influences the spread of contagion.

### 📊 Interactive Dashboards & Slides
View materials from our webinars, including interactive Jupyter widgets and slide decks that bring the models to life.
